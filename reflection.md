This is so hard because I keep trying to do too much...and have no way to figure out how to make the problem smaller. What even am I trying to model? 
Why is it important to use a network to model this transportation system? These seem to be the two primary reasons. 
(1) A network can represent several different relationship types through weighted edges. So if the underlying graph is stations and routes, edges can be weighted according to travel time, frequency of use, and so forth. 
(2) A network can be modified (with disruptions - what will removing the X route do? and who will it impact?)

I feel like a failure because I haven't done anything in 3 weeks. I'm embarrased.

Maybe I should just write a research paper on NYC residents so that I can figure out what the social implications of a public transportation system are.

_____

Maybe I should just use my data analysis / statistics skills on the ACS survey trying to develop some model that depicts the relationship between who you are, where you work, and your usage of public transport

This project should just be about the select bus service and modelling new routes that connect the outer-boroughs.

Oh my god. I don't know what I am doing.

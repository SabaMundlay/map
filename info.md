NYC Mass Transit spatial layers (shapefiles): https://www.baruch.cuny.edu/confluence/display/geoportal/NYC+Mass+Transit+Spatial+Layers <br />
MTA turnstile data (every saturday): http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html <br />
Developer profile w/ MTA (I created one, but have not requested access to any real-time feeds since no app / website development is happening. Maybe in the future when I have a model network I can integrate it with the data?) <br />

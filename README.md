# mapnyc

Dear visitors, 

From Feb - May 2017 I spent a few months doing an independent study exploring transportation networks & playing around with data NYC's bus & subway system, run mainly by the MTA. So this repo is for my advisors to see what I learnt & for others interested in network science as it pertains to public transportation to browse through.

Dear Professor Flynn, Professor Armstrong: 
First and foremost thank you - for giving me the freedom to learn and fail and for being an excellent support system. This independent study has been a failure in many ways...I still have little to no idea what I am doing, I have no pitch-able final product (definitely not one to public policy experts or urban planners), and I feel like I completely dropped this project in the last 3 weeks. But I learned some things, and documented this learning along the way. So this repo is that documentation.

1 year and 7 months later, I finally had an inkling of an idea for how to continue this project. I've been exploring illustration & visual story telling this year. So, take a look at #7 - that's where I'm at now. 

## What is in this: 
(1) reflection: documentation of my emotions and struggles <br />
(2) readshpfile.py: python script (written by Tom Armstrong) to read a shape file <br />
(3) info: the data I found, academic sources I consulted, relevant contacts, and data projets that inspired me <br />
(4) problems: two different (mathematical) formulations of this project, including what type of data and network each requires <br />
(5) Graph A: graph produced using Armstrong's code that shows all the bus routes in NYC <br />
(6) More code about graphs <br />
(7) ## Illustrating with data!!

Dear Professor Flynn, Professor Armstrong, and Professor LeBlanc, 

First and foremost thank you - for giving me the freedom to learn and fail and for being an excellent support system. 

This independent study has been a failure in many ways...I still have little to no idea what I am doing, I have no pitch-able final product (definitely not one to public policy experts or urban planners), and I feel like I completely dropped this project in the last 3 weeks. But I learned some things, and documented this learning along the way. So this repo is that documentation. 

## What is in this: 
(1) reflection: documentation of my emotions and struggles /n
(2) readshpfile.py: python script (written by Tom Armstrong) to read a shape file 
(3) info: the data I found, academic sources I consulted, relevant contacts, and data projets that served as my inspiration
(4) problems: two different formulations of this project, including what type of data and network each requires
